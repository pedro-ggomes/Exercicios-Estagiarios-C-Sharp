# 🚀 C# Coding Exercises for Interns

Welcome to the **C# Coding Exercises for Interns** repository! This collection is designed to help junior developers and interns strengthen their C# programming skills through practical exercises and real-world scenarios.

## 📌 About This Repository

As part of my mentorship initiatives, I've curated these exercises to:

- **Enhance Core C# Skills**: Covering data types, control structures, and object-oriented programming principles.
- **Simulate Real-World Challenges**: Providing tasks that mirror actual development scenarios.
- **Promote Best Practices**: Encouraging clean code, efficient algorithms, and scalable solutions.
- **Prepare for Professional Development**: Equipping interns with the tools and knowledge to excel in backend development roles.
